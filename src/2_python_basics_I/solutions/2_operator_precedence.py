print((5 + 4) * 10 / 2)     # Answer: 9 * 5 = 45.0

print(((5 + 4) * 10) / 2)   # Answer: (9 * 10) / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45.0

print((5 + 4) * (10 / 2))   # Answer: 9 * 5 = 45.0

print(5 + (4 * 10) / 2)     # Answer: 5 + (40 / 2) = 5 + 20 = 25.0

print(5 + 4 * 10 // 2)      # Answer: 5 + (4 * 5) = 5 + 20 = 25
